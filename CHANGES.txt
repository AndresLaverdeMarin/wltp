=======

v0.0.3.alpha, 22-Jan-2014 -- Alpha release
-----------------------------------
* Driveability rules implemented:
*- missing some conditions for rule-f.
*- no test-cases.
- No velocity_real.
- No preparation calculations (eg. vehicle test-mass).
- Still unchecked for correctness of results.
- Experiment tasks:
-- FIXME: Apply rule(e) also for any initial/final gear (not just for i-1).
-- FIXME: move V==0 into own gear.
-- FIXME: move V==0 into own gear.
-- FIXME: NOVATIVE rule: "Clutching gear-2 only when Deccelerating.".
-- FIXME: What to do if no gear foudn for the combination of Power/Revs??
-- NOTE: "interpratation" of specs for Gear-2
-- NOTE: Rule(A) not needed inside x2 loop.
-- NOTE: rule(b2): Applying it only on non-flats may leave gear for less than 3sec!
-- NOTE: Rule(c) should be the last rule to run, outside x2 loop.
-- NOTE: Rule(f): What if extra conditions unsatisfied? Allow shifting for 1 sec only??
-- TODO: Construct a matrix of n_min_drive for all gears, including exceptions for gears 1 & 2.
-- TODO: Prepend row for idle-gear in N_GEARS
-- TODO: Rule(f) implement further constraints.
-- TODO: Simplify V_real calc by avoiding multiply all.


v0.0.2_alpha, 7-Jan-2014 -- Alpha release
-----------------------------------
* Still unchecked for correctness of results.

v0.0.1, 6-Jan-2014 -- Alpha release
-----------------------------------

* Unchecked for correctness.
* Runs OK.
* Project with python-packages and test-cases.
* Tidied code.
* Selects appropriate classes.
* Detects and applies downscale.
* Interpreted and implemented the nonsensical specs concerning ``n_min`` engine-revolutions for gear-2
  (Annex 2-3.2, p71).
- Not implemented yet driveability rules.
- Does not output real_velocity yet - inly gears.

v0.0.0, 11-Dec-2013 -- Inception stage
--------------------------------------

* Mostly setup.py work, README and help.
